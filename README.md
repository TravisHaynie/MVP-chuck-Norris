# MVP-chuck-Norris

## Description
The MVP-chuck-Norris project is a CMS-style blog application built from scratch using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. This blog site allows developers to publish and manage their blog posts and interact with other posts through comments. The application leverages Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize for ORM, and PostgreSQL for the database. It incorporates authentication features for user management and is designed to provide a seamless experience for both reading and writing blog content.

## About the Project
The MVP-chuck-Norris project is a CMS-style blog site designed to enable developers to create, manage, and interact with blog content. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between the applicationâ€™s logic, user interface, and data management. Using technologies such as Handlebars.js for dynamic HTML rendering, Sequelize ORM for database interaction, and express-session for user authentication, this project provides a comprehensive platform for publishing articles, managing user sessions, and engaging with other developers' posts through comments.
